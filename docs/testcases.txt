TEST FRAMEWORK:

For each function:

1. empty()
2. size()
3. top()
4. push()
5. pop()
6. swap()
7. displayStack()

When empty is implemented add the following test cases:

1. [] (empty array) should output true
2. [3,2,1,3,5,2,4] should output false

When size() is implemented add the following test cases:

3. [] (empty array) should output 0
4. [3,2,1,3,5,2,4] should output 7

When top() is implemented add the following test cases:

5. [] should output 0 and print on screen that the stack is empty;
6. [3,2,1,3,5,2,4] should output 4

When push() is implemented add the following test cases:

7. when [] (empty array) and push(8) the output should be [8]

<<<<<TEST CASE 8 IS REDUNDANT, already tested in #2>>>>>
x. when pushing multiple times, ie 
   	
	push(3)
   	push(2)
   	push(1)
   	push(3)
   	push(5)
   	push(2)
   	push(4)

   the output should be [3,2,1,3,5,2,4]

When pop() is implemented add the following test cases:

8. pop() on [3,2,1,3,5,2,4] should be [3,2,1,3,5,2] after pop() and return 4 
9. pop() on an empty array should still have an empty array and return 0 and print that its empty
